\chapter{Model Order Reduction}
\section{Introduction}
Model Order Reduction (MOR) is a technique to reduce the computational effort of simulating a system using mathematical models.
This is done by using two different approaches. The first one is using a numerical approach and the second approach is based on system theory.
The first method discussed is called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. After that Balanced and Modal Truncation will be discussed.
The last method discussed will be Hankel-norm approximation \cite{+2021}.
