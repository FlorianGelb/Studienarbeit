\chapter{Model Order Reduction}
\section{Introduction}
Model Order Reduction (MOR) is a technique to reduce the computational effort of simulate a system using mathematical models.
This is done by modeling only the dominant behaviours of those systems \cite{+2021}.
In control theory a system is described by a system of ODEs:
\begin{gather}
\frac{d}{dt} x = Ax + Bu \\
y = Cx + Du
\end{gather}
This is also called State Space (SS).
The State Space
