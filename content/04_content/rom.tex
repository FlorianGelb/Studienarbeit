\chapter{Model Order Reduction}
\section{Introduction}
Model Order Reduction (MOR) is a technique to reduce the computational effort of simulating a system using mathematical models.
This reduction in effort is done by using two different approaches. The first uses a numerical approach, and the second utilizes system theory.
The first method discussed is called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. After that, Balanced and Modal Truncation will be discussed.
The last method discussed will be Hankel-norm approximation \cite{+2021}.
