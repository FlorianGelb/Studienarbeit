\chapter{Implementation}
The implementation of the discussed methods for solving the heat equation and for model order reduction was done in Matlab.
Matlab was chosen as the programming language because it natively features matrix multiplication which finds heavy use in the previously mentioned methods.
The second reason for this selection is that there exist ToolBoxes that already implement certain model order reduction methods.
