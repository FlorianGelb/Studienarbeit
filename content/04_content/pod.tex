\section{Proper Orthogonal Decomposition}
The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is a method for model order reduction.
The reduction in computational effort is done by approximating a solution to a PDE using an orthogonal expansion.
The basis functions are obtained by decomposing a set of solutions to othe PDE using the SVD.
\subsection{Orthogonal Expansion}
A function \(f: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) can be represented by the series:
\begin{gather}
f(x, t) = \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty}a_i(t)\phi_i(x) \\
x, t \in \mathbb{R} \label{ref-orth-exp}
\end{gather}
Here all \(\phi(x)\) are orthorgonal basis functions.
\begin{gather}
\langle\phi_i, \phi_j\rangle =\begin{cases}
1, \quad \text{if} i = j \\
0, \quad \text{else}
\end{cases} \label{phi-orth}
\end{gather}
By using a finite sum instead of the entire  series \(f\) can be approximated:
\begin{gather}
\tilde{f}(x, t) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n}a_{i}(t)\phi_{i}(x) \label{ref-orth-aprox}
\end{gather}
Since all \(\phi\) are known, \ref{ref-orth-aprox} has to be solved for the set \(\{a_0, ..., a_n\}\).
In case \(f\) is known, the solution for this set is:
\begin{gather}
a_i(t) = \frac{\langle \phi_i, f \rangle}{\langle \phi_i, \phi_i \rangle} \label{sol-ai}
\end{gather}
\cite{Gustafsson2011e}
\subsection{Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for PDEs}
Since a PDEs are equations in terms of partial derivatives, the notation \(\mathscr{P}(\partial \textbf{x}) \textbf{u}\) is introduced, which denotes a differential operator in terms of the spacial variables \(\textbf{x}\) for a function \(u(x,t,\textbf{p}\).
The vector \(\textbf{p}\) contains some parameters.
This is done to provide a more abstract way to denote PDEs:
\begin{gather}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \mathscr{P}(\partial x) u
\end{gather}
\cite{Gustafsson2011f}
Solving for \(u\) is often dificult to imposible.
A method that is often used to solve PDEs is called seperation of variables.
This spereation of variables assumes, that the underlying solution \(u(x, t)\) can be expressed by \ref{ref-orth-exp}, to solve for \(a_k, 0 \leq k \leq n\).
Since it is not practical to compute an infite series, \(u\) only gets appriximated by using \ref{ref-orth-aprox} instead:
\begin{gather}
\sum_{i = 0} ^{n} \frac{\partial a_i}{\partial t} \phi_i = \sum_{i = 0} ^{n} \mathscr{P}(\partial x) \phi_i a_i \label{label-u-aprox} 
\end{gather}
Assuming the spacial dimension got discrezied along \(x\) this can be expressed using marix notation:
\begin{gather}
\Phi = \begin{bmatrix}
\phi_0, ..., \phi_n
\end{bmatrix} \label{mat-phi}\\
\Phi \frac{d}{dt}a = \mathscr{P}(\partial x) \Phi a
\end{gather}
Since the solution \(u\) is unknown \ref{sol-ai} cannot be computed.
However the fact, that all \(\phi\) are orthogonal to each oter, can be used to solve for all \(a_k\).
It can be done by computing the inner product of \ref{label-u-aprox} with all basis funktions:
\begin{gather}
\langle \sum_{i = 0} ^{n} \frac{\partial a_i}{\partial t} \phi_i, \phi_k \rangle = \langle\sum_{i = 0} ^{n} \mathscr{P}(\partial x) \phi_i a_i, \phi_k \rangle \quad \forall 0 \leq k \leq n \label{u-galer}
\end{gather}
This resembles the Galerking projection.
In matrix notation it can be expressed:
\begin{gather}
\Phi^{*}\Phi \frac{d}{dt}a = \Phi^{*}\mathscr{P}(\partial x) \Phi a
\end{gather}
By considering \ref{phi-orth}  the equiation \ref{u-galer} can be expressed as a system of ODEs which can be solved:
\begin{gather}
I \frac{d}{dt} a = \Phi^{*}\mathscr{P}(\partial x) \Phi a
\end{gather}
After the vector of coefficiants \(a\) for each time step has been computed, the solution can be assembled:
\begin{gather}
u(x, t) \approx \Phi(x)a(t)
\end{gather} 
\cite{brunton_kutz_2019c}
\subsection{Choosing basis vectors}
As discussed in the previous section, a set of basis vectors can be used to generate approximate solutions to PDEs.
However it was not discussed how those basis functions are chosen.
For POD to work, a so called snapshot matrix \(X\) has to be available.
This snapshot matrix stores a set of solutions where \(x_k\) is the solution for a PDE at time step \(k\Delta t\):
\begin{gather}
X = \begin{bmatrix}
x_1, ..., x_n
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather}
The solutions can be obtained by conducting an expirment on a physical system that is described by the PDE or by simulating the evolution of that PDE.
In this paper the solution is obtained using FEM \ref{FEM}.
SVD is used to decompose the snapshot matrix \(X\).
Since the columns of the snapshot matrix contain spacial information at a given point in time and the basis vectors are supposed to encode the spacial information of a solution \(u\) the \(r\) most dominant left singular values have to be extracted:
\begin{gather}
\tilde{X} = \tilde{U}\tilde{\Sigma}\tilde{V}^{*} \\
\Phi = [u_1, ..., u_r]
\end{gather}
Here the FEM solution is obtained by discretizing the PDE into a large number(\(n\)) of spacial nodes.
This results in a high dimensional system of ODEs.
Since \(\Phi\) contains only \(r\) column (\(r << n\)) vectors a reduction in order can be achieved.
However the benefits of this reduced order model are only relevant after the PDE has been solved once using a high dimensional system of ODEs.
