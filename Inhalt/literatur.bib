pages="255--262",
abstract="The prediction of heat and temperature distribution in a material is of great importance in many applications. The conduction of heat has certain similarities with diffusion. The mathematical model is in both cases a parabolic PDE with the typical property that rapid variations in the state variables are smoothed out with time. We have treated the simplest version of such equations earlier in this book, but here we shall look into its properties a little further. We shall also take a look at the steady state problem which leads to elliptic equations.",

title="Finite Element Methods",
bookTitle="Fundamentals of Scientific Computing",
year="2011",
publisher="Springer Berlin Heidelberg",
address="Berlin, Heidelberg",
pages="173--192",
abstract="Finite element methods (FEM) were used very early for problems in structural mechanics. Such problems often have a natural discretization by partitioning the structure in a number of finite elements, and this gave the name to this class of methods. This kind of mechanical approach merged with the more mathematical approach that gained momentum in the 1960s.",
